# WinBots
The object of this game is to escape the onslaught of the robot invasion, destroying them in the process. You can use your mouse
or the keyboard to move about.  Wherever you go, the robots will seek you out. Stay alive as long as possible through cunning,
teleporting and use of your sonic screwdriver to vaporise the robots adjacent to you.  You recharge your sonic screwdriver once
each level and if you do not use it, the charge accumulates.
